# Internship Project Report

## Project Title
Cloud-Based Monitoring with AWS CloudWatch and Google Cloud Monitoring

## Objective
To implement a monitoring solution for cloud-based applications that includes:
- Dashboards for visual monitoring
- Alerts for CPU usage
- Cross-cloud support (AWS and GCP)

## Technologies Used
- AWS CloudWatch (Metrics, Alarms, Dashboards)
- Google Cloud Monitoring (Alerting Policies, Dashboards)
- AWS CLI and Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)
- Shell scripting (Bash)
- JSON for configuration templates

## My Contribution
- Created pre-configured scripts and templates for alarms and dashboards
- Wrote automated scripts for setting up CPU monitoring
- Documented the process for easy deployment

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding cloud metric filters and threshold expressions
- Ensuring permissions (IAM roles and API access) were in place
- Testing alerts without triggering false positives

## Future Enhancements
- Add monitoring for memory, disk, and network
- Automate setup using Terraform or CloudFormation
- Set up multi-instance dashboard views
